# Tetris Multiplayer

This is a project inspired by the game of the 90s, by the company Atari

## Challenge Creation

The game I built was "Tetris", when the objective is to stack the pieces that go down the screen, which can appear mirrored and be rotated, at a speed that gradually increases with each level of difficulty, in order to complete horizontal lines.
